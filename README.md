## Predict Employee Turnover with Decision Trees and Random Forests

In this project, I've used Python and scikit-learn to grow decision trees and random forests, and apply them to predict employee turnover, which is the measurement of the number of employees who leave an organization during a specified time period. The project also makes use of Jupyter widgets to build interactive controls so that we can change the parameters of the models on the fly with graphical controls, and see the results in real time.

Please have a look at the notebook [here](employee-turnover-prediction.ipynb), or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14UshZoO5GtoqbcMB9-j0VwMINGVMXyaq/view?usp=sharing).
